    Have never liked reading and guess and check seemed like a good way to code. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

About the Robot -->

-- 
The robot currently has who simetrical linear lifts powered by two hd:hex 20:1 rev motors. The lift caries our element container up to the lander. The element container collects elemts with a motor which control small tubes glued to a large tube kind of like bristels on a brush. We have four motors on our drive train and are using standard grip wheels on the back and onmi wheels on the front. For our team marker we are just using 1 servo. For our lifiting mechanism we are using a chain linear slide system and a gear box (sadly I forgot the gear ratio).
